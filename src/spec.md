# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Add expandable details tables to monthly, yearly, and multi-yearly summary sections showing all expenses for each time period.

**Planned changes:**
- Add a "Details" button below each time period summary (monthly, yearly, multi-yearly)
- Implement inline expandable tables that display all expenses with date, category, amount, and description columns
- Each details section can be expanded/collapsed independently with toggle functionality
- Create backend query method to fetch expenses within specified date ranges

**User-visible outcome:** Users can click "Details" buttons below each time period summary to view a complete table of all expenses for that period, with each section expanding and collapsing independently.
